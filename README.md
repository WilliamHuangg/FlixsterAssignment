### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt the lectures and labs were very helpful in guiding me to completing the weekly assignment. I felt the giphy lecture and lab was very useful. I felt confused while implementing the pop-up portion of the assignment.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would focus on stylizing my webpage and making it more welcoming. I would also try to fix the load more movies button as I attempted to use a conditional to make it work but was unsuccessful. I found a work-around to my problem by having two buttons, but the search button would be hidden untill a word was searched. One of the buttons would load more current playing movies while the other would appear when a movie was searched.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

What went well for me is that I was able to request information from the API and take that info to be presented on my page. What did not go as planned was adding the show more buttons as the API links were different and I was confused on how to proceed. I found a work-around by having two separate buttons for loading more movies. One for current movies and one for the searched movies. When I was doing the popup portion for the movies I struggled to have the poster image overlap the background image. I noticed my peers used libraries to help them with their pop-ups which I would like to try next time.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

I would like to shout-out everyone I have worked with this week as they were able to assit me whenever I had a problem.
